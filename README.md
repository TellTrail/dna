# TellTrail

TellTrail is dedicated to the responsible management and transfer of personal information to third parties.  Information about the TellTrail project can be found at [TellTrail.me](http://telltrail.me/).

This repository, **dna**, does not contain code, but rather documents the primary purpose, structure, methodology and protocols for TellTrail.  Other repositories will follow, containing actual code to implement these protocols.

## What is TellTrail?

> **To get a quick idea of the TellTrail concept, see the [manifesto](MANIFESTO.md).**

TellTrail is data privacy project. As personal data collection becomes increasingly ubiquitous, we believe a mechanism for an individual's control over data about them will become necessary.  The TellTrail project will seek to build the technical, legal and advocacy infrastructure necessary to support this mechanism.

The focus of TellTrail is **data transfer** to third parties. When an individual interacts with an organization it is expected that the organization will gain knowledge of the individual to some degree, either through explicit divulgence of information by the individual, or through observation of it. In the past this has been naturally limited by technology, however now it is possible to collect massive amounts of data on an individual, with increasingly trivial cost.

When that data is then transferred to a third party, either through the selling or that data or other means, it can have unintended consequences for the individual. It isn't hard to imagine a world where one's diet is monitored and results in higher health insurance costs, or one's reading habits are monitored, with the information affecting one's employment prospects. As the cost of data collection and transfer on an individual approaches zero, the consequences of this uncontrolled transfer of personal information become ever greater.

TellTrail operates from the perspective that while data *about* an individual may not belong to that person, they are nonetheless a stakeholder in that data, and should have a say in how it is transferred to third parties.

## With What Parties is TellTrail Concerned?

The TellTrail ecosystem is concerned with 4 types of parties:

The **Data Citizen** is an individual about whom data is collected and transferred.  They may not own the data in question, but they are an interested stakeholder in it.

The **Data Producer** is the creator and initial owner of the data about the Data Citizen.  Their data comes into existence either because it is divulged to them by the Data Citizen, or it is through observation of and/or inference about the Data Citizen.

The **Data Consumer** is a party that acquires data from the Data Producer, either by buying it or through other mechanisms.

The **Data Exchange** facilitates the transfer of data from Data Producers to Data Consumers.

In the real world it is, of course, possible for an organization to fulfill more than one role.

## How Will TellTrail Work?

TellTrail will ultimately operate on three levels: technology, legal and advocacy.

The **technology** branch of TellTrail will create a solution to allow Data Citizens to express control over data about them.  This is largely based on **data policies** which are expressions of Data Citizen rules about data transfer, defined at various levels of granularity.  Specifics about TellTrail technology can be found TK.

The **legal** branch of TellTrail will create the legal licensing framework that reinforces the technology solution. It will consist of a series of trademark licenses and enforcement procedure.  Information about the TellTrail legal framework can be found TK.

The **advocacy** branch of TellTrail is dedicated to the education and advancement of the public about TellTrail and what it offers.  The goal of the advocacy effort is to create public knowledge and support for TellTrail.
