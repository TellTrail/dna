# TellTrail

TellTrail is dedicated to the responsible management and transfer of personal information to third parties.  Information about the TellTrail project can be found at [TellTrail.me](http://telltrail.me/).

This repository, **dna**, does not contain code, but rather documents the primary purpose, structure, methodology and protocols for TellTrail.  Other repositories will follow, containing actual code to implement these protocols.
